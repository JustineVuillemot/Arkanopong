# Arkanopong

## What is it ?

Arkanopong is a game that mixes the idea of the Pong game and the Breakout game.

## Why do this project ?

It was a project realised during a C/OpenGL course at IMAC engineering school in Paris.

## How to test it ?

### With a Linux environment

The project was coded on a Debian environment so you can easily launch it just after download by executing the file in the `/bin` folder of the project.

### With a windows environment

I haven't personnaly tested it but I think it could be launched with a compiler like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks or Clion.

## Credits

The project was coded with Pauline Legros who can not appear on this repo because the project was added after being finished. We both worked equally together to create it.
